Update Nov 2018: Apologies, I underestimated the "potential" of Netgate - see Addendum #2.

# Addendum

Chris Buechler, the co-founder and former project leader of pfSense [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13615424) on the project's direction and Jim Thompson's leadership skills:

And here's [another one](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=6467.msg28077#msg28077) from Chris, this time on the false open-source claims and [unfair competition/opnsense.com affair](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/tree/master/opnsense) (which finally made it even to the [Wikipedia article on pfSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense)):

# Addendum #2

_"To the benefit of even greater customer value"_ this "open-source" company is planning to [retrofit all pfSense installs with a DRM "solution"](https://www.netgate.com/blog/fake-news-annoying-fake-product-serious.html).

Yeah sure, an "open-source" firewall that I cannot tweak in any way (or it refuses to work), nor use my own (or third-party) packages for it (or it refuses to work) and where some proprietary blob decides whether I am _"authorized to receive software and package updates"_, that is *exactly* why people choose open-source solutions. Good that _"there is potential to take product verification much further"_. You got it spot on, Gonzo...

**Run, Forrest, run!!!**
